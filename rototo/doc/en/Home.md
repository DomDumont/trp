# Introduction

T.R.P. is an engine to make games for children so don't expect it to be the next UNITY killer ;-)

T.R.P. cannot compete with other engines like Cocos2dx or LibGDX but it should be enough to make small games
in a relatively good environment.


T.R.P. makes you feel at home. You work on Windows or osx with your preferred text editor.
You can then connect as many clients as you want (ios and/or android) to see the final result in real time.

Android and IOS versions are ready but still being tested and are not yet publicly available.
But don't wait and start playing with the Win32 or OSX versions.
