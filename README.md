# The Rototo Project

( FYI a rototo is a baby burp in french )

* T.R.P. is an engine to make games for children so don't expect it to be the next UNITY killer ;-)
* T.R.P. cannot compete with other engines like Cocos2dx or LibGDX but it should be enough to make small games in a relatively good environment.
* T.R.P. makes you feel at home. You work on Windows, osx or linux with your preferred text editor (or with ratata, the IDE). You can then connect as many clients as you want (ios and/or android) to see the final result in real time.
 
T.R.P. is in an early alpha stage with lots of stuff missing and crashes but it starts to be fun ;-)
